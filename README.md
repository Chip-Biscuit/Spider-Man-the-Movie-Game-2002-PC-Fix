This is the spiderman 2002 PC d3d8 wrapper and Fix Files.

Simply go to releases and download the ZIP file then extract it and move/ copy the d3d8.dll and d3d8.ini to your games install location next to SpiderMan.exe.

Always read the README included.

We are aware that in this game there is an isue with cutscenes/ movies not scaling properly and playing in a small box. This issue is currently being worked on with hopes of being fixed,
so keep an eye on any future updates where this problem may be fixed but for now please be patient on this matter, Thankyou.

If you get a crashing issue you may have to just re name the folder in your games install location (movies) to (movies none) so that the game plays with no movies at all whilst the crashing issue is investigated.

Make sure you got the 1.3 patch for this game before you play it its important you can get it here

you can edit settings in d3d8.ini
