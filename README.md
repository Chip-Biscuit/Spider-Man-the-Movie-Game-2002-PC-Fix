# Requirements before using fix
For the fix to work properly you must have patched the game up to the 1.3 release, which also contains major bug fixes. If you have not done so already then you can download the patch from here - https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/791-spider-man-the-movie-patch-13/ 

# Important Information
We are aware of an issue with the games FMVs/Movies not scaling correctly and currently playing in a small box. This problem is being worked on but is a very complicated issue to resolve so will take time to fix properly. So please do keep an eye on future updates in the releases area for updated downloads of the fix where this issue may be fixed, however, for now please be patient regarding this issue, thank you!

If you are experiencing a crashing issue with the FMVs/Movies then you may have to re name the folder in your games install location ‘Movies’ to a different name such as ‘Movies Broken’ so then the game plays without the movies at all whilst the crashing issue is being looked into.

# Instructions
Go to releases and download the latest spiderman2002fix. zip, extract the d3d8.dll and d3d8.ini files into your game folder next to the SpiderMan.exe file and you are good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d8.ini file.

# Resolution/Aspect Ratio
The default for resolution is (2) (1920x1080), which you can change by changing the (2) and choosing the correct number for your resolution.

Resolution and aspect ratio edits are done together so you will only have to choose your resolution.

# FPS
The default for FPS is (60) you can change it as you wish or fully uncap it with (0) with the FPSLimit option in the d3d8.ini file.

# FOV
The default for FOV is (0) which is the original games FOV. You can choose either 1,2,3 or 4 in the d3d8.ini file and each option will increase the FOV in game.
